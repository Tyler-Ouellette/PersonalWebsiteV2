I'm a student at the University of Windsor in Honours of Applied Computing for University Graduates program and I will graduate May 2020. I currently have a degree in Human Kinetics (Kinesiology) specializing in Movement Science. I had worked full-time in the field for a year and realized I wanted a change. I've now fallen in love with computer science, web development and security. I love to build things and learn new things. I want to eventually get my Security+, Pentest+, then GPEN certificates and work as a penetration tester.

###### Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

-   HTML & CSS
-   Javascript (ES6+)
-   React
-   Node
-   Express
-   Gatsby
-   GraphQL
-   Vue
-   PHP
