Halo Medals was a personal project started when Halo Infinite was released. I loved the game, and love earning medals in game. The problem being, the game itself doesn't ever display my total amount of medals. I found a way to get the data and created my own initial version to get my medals. After showing it off to friends, they asked if they could use it too. So I redesigned it, allowed users to search for their Gamertag and published it. It has had many interations which now includes more than just medals, but stats, match history, and Service Record. The website is built with Node, Express, React.
